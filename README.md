# Python-color-picker

Maybe my hardest project so far. It is a traditional color picker. it uses pynput to get the mouse position, [getpixelcolor](https://github.com/9021007/GetPixelColor) to .. well, and tkinter to open a window that shows the color and the RGB and HEX code.

As with all my projects it is frankensteined together by Stackoverflow, [Pythontutorial.net for the text](https://www.pythontutorial.net/tkinter/tkinter-text/) and the ai response by duckduckgo (i am sorry for relying on ai, but it popped right into my sight and i read it)
